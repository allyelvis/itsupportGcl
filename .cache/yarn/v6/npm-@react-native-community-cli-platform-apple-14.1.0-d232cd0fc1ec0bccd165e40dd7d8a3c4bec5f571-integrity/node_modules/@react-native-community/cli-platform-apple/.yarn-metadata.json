It contains utilities for building reusable commands targeting Apple platforms.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nyarn add @react-native-community/cli-platform-apple\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis package is intended to be used internally in [React Native CLI](../../README.md) and by out of tree platforms.\n\nIt exports builder commands that can be used to create custom `run-`, `log-` and `build-` commands for example: `yarn run-<oot-platform>`.\n\nInside of `<oot-platform>/packages/react-native/react-native.config.js`:\n\n```js\nconst {\n  getBuildOptions,\n  createBuild,\n} = require('@react-native-community/cli-platform-apple');\n\nconst buildVisionOS = {\n  name: 'build-visionos',\n  description: 'builds your app for visionOS platform',\n  func: createBuild({platformName: 'visionos'}),\n  examples: [\n    {\n      desc: 'Build the app for visionOS in Release mode',\n      cmd: 'npx react-native build-visionos --mode \"Release\"',\n    },\n  ],\n  options: getBuildOptions({platformName: 'visionos'}),\n};\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  commands: [buildVisionOS], // <- Add command here\n  //..\n};\n```\n\n`cli-platform-apple` also exports utilities to create OOT platform config.\n\n- `getProjectConfig()` - creates project config for given platform\n- `getDependencyConfig()` - creates dependency config for given platform\n\nExample (`<oot-platform>/packages/react-native/react-native.config.js`):\n\n```js\nplatforms: {\n    visionos: {\n      npmPackageName: '@callstack/react-native-visionos',\n      projectConfig: getProjectConfig({platformName: 'visionos'}),\n      dependencyConfig: getDependencyConfig({platformName: 'visionos'}),\n    },\n    ..\n  },\n```\n",
