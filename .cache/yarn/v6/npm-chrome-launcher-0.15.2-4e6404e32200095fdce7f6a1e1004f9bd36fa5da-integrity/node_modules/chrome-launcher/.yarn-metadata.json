For many cases [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) is recommended, though it has its own chrome launching mechanism.\n\n### Installing\n\n```sh\nyarn add chrome-launcher\n\n# or with npm:\nnpm install chrome-launcher\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### `.launch([opts])`\n\n#### Launch options\n\n```js\n{\n  // (optional) remote debugging port number to use. If provided port is already busy, launch() will reject\n  // Default: an available port is autoselected\n  port: number;\n\n  // (optional) Additional flags to pass to Chrome, for example: ['--headless', '--disable-gpu']\n  // See: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-launcher/blob/main/docs/chrome-flags-for-tools.md\n  // Do note, many flags are set by default: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-launcher/blob/main/src/flags.ts\n  chromeFlags: Array<string>;\n\n  // (optional) Additional preferences to be set in Chrome, for example: {'download.default_directory': __dirname}\n  // See: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/chrome/common/pref_names.cc\n  // Do note, if you set preferences when using your default profile it will overwrite these\n  prefs: {[key: string]: Object};\n\n  // (optional) Close the Chrome process on `Ctrl-C`\n  // Default: true\n  handleSIGINT: boolean;\n\n  // (optional) Explicit path of intended Chrome binary\n Â // * If this `chromePath` option is defined, it will be used.\n  // * Otherwise, the `CHROME_PATH` env variable will be used if set. (`LIGHTHOUSE_CHROMIUM_PATH` is deprecated)\n Â // * Otherwise, a detected Chrome Canary will be used if found\n  // * Otherwise, a detected Chrome (stable) will be used\n  chromePath: string;\n\n  // (optional) Chrome profile path to use, if set to `false` then the default profile will be used.\n  // By default, a fresh Chrome profile will be created\n  userDataDir: string | boolean;\n\n  // (optional) Starting URL to open the browser with\n  // Default: `about:blank`\n  startingUrl: string;\n\n  // (optional) Logging level\n  // Default: 'silent'\n  logLevel: 'verbose'|'info'|'error'|'silent';\n\n  // (optional) Flags specific in [flags.ts](src/flags.ts) will not be included.\n  // Typically used with the defaultFlags() method and chromeFlags option.\n  // Default: false\n  ignoreDefaultFlags: boolean;\n\n  // (optional) Interval in ms, which defines how often launcher checks browser port to be ready.\n  // Default: 500\n  connectionPollInterval: number;\n\n  // (optional) A number of retries, before browser launch considered unsuccessful.\n  // Default: 50\n  maxConnectionRetries: number;\n\n  // (optional) A dict of environmental key value pairs to pass to the spawned chrome process.\n  envVars: {[key: string]: string};\n};\n```\n\n#### Launched chrome interface\n\n#### `.launch().then(chrome => ...`\n\n```js\n// The remote debugging port exposed by the launched chrome\nchrome.port: number;\n\n// Method to kill Chrome (and cleanup the profile folder)\nchrome.kill: () => Promise<void>;\n\n// The process id\nchrome.pid: number;\n\n// The childProcess object for the launched Chrome\nchrome.process: childProcess\n```\n\n### `ChromeLauncher.Launcher.defaultFlags()`\n\nReturns an `Array<string>` of the default [flags](docs/chrome-flags-for-tools.md) Chrome is launched with. Typically used along with the `ignoreDefaultFlags` and `chromeFlags` options.\n\nNote: This array will exclude the following flags: `--remote-debugging-port` `--disable-setuid-sandbox` `--user-data-dir`.\n\n### `ChromeLauncher.Launcher.getInstallations()`\n\nReturns an `Array<string>` of paths to available Chrome installations. When `chromePath` is not provided to `.launch()`, the first installation returned from this method is used instead.\n\nNote: This method performs synchronous I/O operations.\n\n### `.killAll()`\n\nAttempts to kill all Chrome instances created with [`.launch([opts])`](#launchopts). Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of errors that occurred while killing instances. If all instances were killed successfully, the array will be empty.\n\n```js\nconst ChromeLauncher = require('chrome-launcher');\n\nasync function cleanup() {\n  await ChromeLauncher.killAll();\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n#### Launching chrome:\n\n```js\nconst ChromeLauncher = require('chrome-launcher');\n\nChromeLauncher.launch({\n  startingUrl: 'https://google.com'\n}).then(chrome => {\n  console.log(`Chrome debugging port running on ${chrome.port}`);\n});\n```\n\n\n#### Launching headless chrome:\n\n```js\nconst ChromeLauncher = require('chrome-launcher');\n\nChromeLauncher.launch({\n  startingUrl: 'https://google.com',\n  chromeFlags: ['--headless', '--disable-gpu']\n}).then(chrome => {\n  console.log(`Chrome debugging port running on ${chrome.port}`);\n});\n```\n\n#### Launching with support for extensions and audio:\n\n```js\nconst ChromeLauncher = require('chrome-launcher');\n\nconst newFlags = ChromeLauncher.Launcher.defaultFlags().filter(flag => flag !== '--disable-extensions' && flag !== '--mute-audio');\n\nChromeLauncher.launch({\n  ignoreDefaultFlags: true,\n  chromeFlags: newFlags,\n}).then(chrome => { ... });\n```\n\n### Continuous Integration\n\nIn a CI environment like Travis, Chrome may not be installed. If you want to use `chrome-launcher`, Travis can [install Chrome at run time with an addon](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/chrome).  Alternatively, you can also install Chrome using the [`download-chrome.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-launcher/v0.8.0/scripts/download-chrome.sh) script.\n\nThen in `.travis.yml`, use it like so:\n\n```yaml\nlanguage: node_js\ninstall:\n  - yarn install\nbefore_script:\n  - export DISPLAY=:99.0\n  - export CHROME_PATH=\"$(pwd)/chrome-linux/chrome\"\n  - sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start\n  - sleep 3 # wait for xvfb to boot\n\naddons:\n  chrome: stable\n```\n",
