    "readme": "marky\n======\n\nJavaScript timer based on `performance.mark()` and `performance.measure()`, providing [high-resolution\ntimings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API) as well as nice Dev Tools visualizations.\n\nFor browsers that don't support `performance.mark()`, it falls back to \n`performance.now()` or `Date.now()`. In Node, it uses `process.hrtime()`.\n\nQuick start\n----\n\nInstall via npm:\n\n    npm install marky\n\nOr as a script tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/marky/dist/marky.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThen take some measurements:\n\n```js\nvar marky = require('marky');\n\nmarky.mark('expensive operation');\ndoExpensiveOperation();\nmarky.stop('expensive operation');\n```\n\nWhy?\n---\n\nThe [User Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API) is [more performant](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/2fad3834e2617fb199bc12e17058dde4)\nthan `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()`,\nand [more accurate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now) than `Date.now()`. Also, you get nice visualizations in Chrome Dev Tools:\n\n![Chrome Dev Tools screenshot](doc/chrome.png)\n\nAs well as Edge F12 Tools:\n\n![Edge F12 screenshot](doc/edge.png)\n\nThis is because `marky` adds standard\n[PerformanceEntries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry) to the [Performance Timeline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_Timeline). Tools like [WebPageTest](http://blog.patrickmeenan.com/2013/07/measuring-performance-of-user-experience.html) and [Windows Performance Analyzer](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/05/11/top-down-analysis-wpt/) also surface them, and you can even [send them to your analytics provider](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/performance-analytics).\n\nAPI\n---\n\n`marky.mark()` begins recording, and `marky.stop()` finishes recording:\n\n```js\nmarky.mark('releaseTheHounds');\nreleaseTheHounds();\nmarky.stop('releaseTheHounds');\n```\n\nYou can also do more complex scenarios:\n\n```js\nfunction setSail() {\n  marky.mark('setSail');\n  marky.mark('raiseTheAnchor');\n  raiseTheAnchor();\n  marky.stop('raiseTheAnchor');\n  marky.mark('unfurlTheSails');\n  unfurlTheSails();\n  marky.stop('unfurlTheSails');\n  marky.stop('setSail');\n}\n```\n\n`marky.stop()` also returns a `PerformanceEntry`:\n\n```js\nmarky.mark('manTheTorpedos');\nmanTheTorpedos();\nvar entry = marky.stop('manTheTorpedos');\n```\n\nThe entry will look something like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entryType\": \"measure\",\n  \"startTime\": 1974112,\n  \"duration\": 350,\n  \"name\": \"manTheTorpedos\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can get all entries using:\n\n```js\nvar entries = marky.getEntries();\n```\n\nThis provides a list of all measures ordered by `startTime`, e.g.:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"entryType\": \"measure\",\n    \"startTime\": 1974112,\n    \"duration\": 350,\n    \"name\": \"numberOne\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"entryType\": \"measure\",\n    \"startTime\": 1975108,\n    \"duration\": 300,\n    \"name\": \"numberTwo\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"entryType\": \"measure\",\n    \"startTime\": 1976127,\n    \"duration\": 250,\n    \"name\": \"numberThree\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nYou can also clear the entries using `marky.clear():`\n\n```js\nmarky.clear()\n```\n\nAfter this, `marky.getEntries()` will return an empty list. (If the User Timing API is supported, this will delete all the `mark` and `measure` entries from the timeline.)\n\nBrowser support\n----\n\n`marky` has been tested in the following browsers/environments:\n\n* IE 9+\n* Safari 8+\n* iOS 8+\n* Android 4.4+\n* Chrome\n* Firefox\n* Edge\n* Node 4+\n\nPer [the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing-1/#extensions-performance-interface), browsers only need to hold a minimum\nof 150 entries in their Performance Timeline buffer. [In older versions of Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1331135), the buffer\nis throttled to 150, which for `marky`\nmeans you can get a maximum of 50 entries from `marky.getEntries()` (because `marky` creates two marks and a measure).\n\nIf you need to get more than 50 entries from `marky.getEntries()`, you can do:\n\n```js\nif (typeof performance !== 'undefined' && performance.setResourceTimingBufferSize) {\n  performance.setResourceTimingBufferSize(10000); // or however many you need\n}\n```\n\nIn Node and [browsers that don't support the User Timing API](http://caniuse.com/#feat=user-timing),\n`marky` follows the behavior of Edge and Chrome, and does not limit the number of entries. `marky.stop()` and \n`marky.getEntries()` will return pseudo-`PerformanceEntry` objects.\n\nSee also\n---\n\n- [appmetrics.js](https://github.com/ebidel/appmetrics.js) â€“ a library on top of `mark()`/`measure()` which reports to Google Analytics.\n\nCredits\n----\n\nThanks to [@toddreifsteck](https://github.com/toddreifsteck) for feedback on this project and clarifications on the User Timing API.\n",
